  # MultiTouch actions allow for multiple touches to happen at the same time,
  # for instance, to simulate multiple finger swipes.
  #
  # Create a series of touch actions by themselves (without a `prepare()`), then
  # add to a new MultiTouch action.  When ready, call `prepare()` and all
  # actions will be executed simultaneously.
  #
  # @example
  #
  #   action_1 = TouchAction.new.press(x: 45, y: 100).wait(5).release
  #   action_2 = TouchAction.new.tap(element: el, x: 50, y:5, count: 3)

  #   driver = Appium::Driver.new(opts, false).start_driver # return an Appium::Core::Base::Driver instance
